# SSH to local environment

To update the data into the container you can use the phpStorm deployment tool with the following credentials.  
  
  
| Info | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| Host | 127.0.0.1 |
| Port | 2222 |
| Directory | /data/shop/development |
| Mapping | / |
| Username | root |
| Password | nexus123 |

Also i would suggest to exclude the local vendor and node_modules directories.
